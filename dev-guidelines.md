# Developer Guidelines

### First you have to fork or clone this repository

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:mr-zlaam/fiverr-server.git
```

### Installing dependencies

You have to use `yarn` instead of `npm` as it will conflict with already existed lock files

```bash
    yarn install
```

### Starting development server

```bash
    yarn dev
```

# Developer Guidelines

### First you have to fork or clone this repository
  ``` bash
    git clone git@github.com:mr-zlaam/fiverr-server.git
  ```

###  Installing dependencies
 You have to use `yarn` instead of  `npm` as it will conflict with already existed  lock files
``` bash
    yarn install
```

``` bash
    yarn dev
```
otherwise:

use this command for development server
```bash
    yarn start:dev
```
